                                <p>
                                    As you can see in the first graph, there does appear to be some sort of trend appearing between the atomic number and the atomic radius. The trend begins with a the values being higher, followed by a steep decline, and then the decline begins to slow down until it jumps back up to repeat the cycle. The atomic radius seems to be slowly inclining as the atomic number increases as well. This would mean atoms with higher proton counts must also have higher atomic radii.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The pattern between the atomic numbers and ionization energy look very similar to the previous graph. In this case, however, the elements seem to be having less deviation as their atomic numbers increase, with huge variations in the begining, but becoming stable later on. Not only does the energy seem to have less variation, it's also decreasing in magnitude as a general trend.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So why do I think this may be? Well, in the trend between the atomic number and the radius, a small factor could be it needs to expand to fit more subatomic particles. Adding more protons causes the nucleus to be larger, at least logically it should, thusly pushing everything else out more. This could explain why the trend is so slow. A possible explanation for this <i>pushing</i> is that with more protons inside the nucleus, more of a positive charge builds up, repelling the negitivly charged electrons, causing a larger atomic radius.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Does this fit into the trends we've been learning about? I think so. The trends in the various graphs I was looking at with the collected data seem to match up with the periodic trends we've been learning about. If the trends don't match what we've learned, there's only two possible reasons. Either I messed up while collecting data, or physics has suddenly changed, which would be horrible.

                                    <h3>The magic of Gold</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As apart of the assignment, I need to pick a specific element to research. I decided on gold, since it is one of the most well known semiconductor used in digital appliances. Gold has many uses, actually. One super well known one is joulery, because of the shiny reflective surface, many people find gold desirable purely for asthetical reasons. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Gold was discovered in approximately 3000 BC, and being that it has been around for so long, we don't know who exactly discovered it. However, since gold is a natural resource, it didn't have to be invented, just have somebody long ago see a shiny rock they like and begin using it. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One main unique property of gold, is that it's not quite a conductor, but not an insulator either. Gold is a semiconductor, which is very useful in modern day electrical computing. Semiconductors are like conductor, but have a higher resistance to current flow. This is useful in specific applications, such as potentiometers.
